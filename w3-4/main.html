                <summary>Useful information</summary>
                <p>Vegetables are the source of many diseases, for example, the consumption of acids, dyes, roughage and other beneficial compounds with bactericidal properties. Vitamins such as beta-carotene or vitamin C found in fruits 
                    and vegetables are effective antioxidants.Since vegetables contain a lot of water and few energy-rich components, they contain few calories and are stored for a very short time. But there are exceptions, such as potatoes and legumes. 
                    Thanks to starch, their calorie content is much higher than in other vegetables. Carrots, beets, sweet green peas and cabbage contain sucrose and monosaccharides. It should be remembered that old vegetables already have too much 
                    dietary fiber and are therefore not suitable for juices and salads.
                    If you eat vegetables at least 5 times a day, then your body will be more resistant to various diseases. In addition, it has a positive effect on overall well-being. Unfortunately, the human body cannot accumulate useful vitamins and other elements. 
                    As an example, consider vitamin C. It is found in many natural foods and is well absorbed. To maintain the required level of vitamin C in the body, one must constantly take care of the use of foods containing this vitamin,
                    such as peppers, broccoli, spinach, parsley, dill, Brussels sprouts, etc.
                    Almost all vegetables need to be stored in the refrigerator. The exception is unripe vegetables, because at room temperature they will become a little more ripe. 
                    Also, long-term storage products, such as potatoes and beets, are not required to be stored in the refrigerator, but it is desirable. The most comfortable place in the refrigerator for vegetables is the bottom drawer. 
                    Many of them can be safely stored there for up to 1 month. But most vegetables are better to use during the week. If you freeze or buy frozen vegetables, then be calm, 
                    because they remain tasty and healthy for a very long time – up to one year. Canned vegetables should be stored in a cool dark place, the optimal temperature should be below 15 degrees.

                <p>
                    Fruits have little energy value and a lot of water, so it is advisable to consume them at least 5 times a day. The presence of elements such as potassium and calcium makes it possible to attribute fruits to the alkaline group of products.
                    Lemon acid is caused by the presence of organic acids, but they do not form acid.Jam and confiture are usually made from fresh fruit, but unfortunately, most of the fruit vitamins are lost during their preparation. However, 
                    the energy value of such products remains high due to the large amount of sugar. Confitures of industrial production contain preservatives.Not everyone knows that, among other things, vegetables and fruits are a natural cure for sclerosis and cancer. 
                    Ascorbic acid must be in the daily diet, because our body cannot accumulate it. Since different vegetables contain different vitamins, you need to make sure that you have all the necessary fruits in your diet. Even though the energy value of fruits is quite low, excessive consumption of some of them can have an unimportant effect on health.
                    For example, eating more than the recommended amount of bananas can lead to weight gain.
